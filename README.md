# Galois Field Calculator

A finite field, also known as a Galois field, is a mathematical structure that consists of a finite set of elements along with two operations, usually addition and multiplication, that satisfy a specific set of properties. This calculator focuses on binary extension fields (GF($2^m$)) of user-defined m.


## Finite Field Arithmetic Example
In terms of binary extension fields, the following rules apply:
- The coefficients, $a_{i}$, of the polynomials are defined such that
    - $\forall$ $a_{i} \in$ {0, 1}
- p(x) exists and is an irreducible polynomial over the field
- The field supports exact division
